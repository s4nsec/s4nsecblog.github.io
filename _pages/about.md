I am Sanan Hasanov, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida (UCF), where I am advised by Prof. Dr. [Paul Gazzillo](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/person/paul-gazzillo/). As a member of the [APPLeSEEd Lab](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/research/appleseed-lab/), my research focuses on systems security, kernel fuzzing, and vulnerability research. I am passionate about exploring new techniques to enhance software security by leveraging configuration-aware fuzzing and automated testing tools.

Before joining UCF, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering at Baku Higher Oil School, where I developed a strong foundation in software development and security. Throughout my academic journey, I have been involved in several research projects, contributing to the advancement of kernel fuzzing techniques and the discovery of vulnerabilities in complex systems.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained professional experience as a Research Intern at **Trail of Bits** and **Margin Research**, where I worked on enhancing open-source security tools and developing novel methods for bug detection and exploitation. My time at Trail of Bits, in particular, involved contributing to the value generation logic of the Medusa fuzzer, which resulted in significant improvements in bug discovery and call sequence speed.

I am highly skilled in programming languages and tools such as Python, Go, C, Bash, Syzkaller, QEMU, Docker, and AWS. I am always eager to collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of security research and software reliability.

When I'm not delving into research or writing code, I enjoy sharing knowledge through teaching and mentoring, contributing to open-source projects, and volunteering in the academic community.
