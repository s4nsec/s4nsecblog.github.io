This research introduces an optimized method for selecting configurations in continuous kernel fuzzing environments. By fine-tuning the configuration selection process, we achieved a more efficient and effective approach to vulnerability discovery in large codebases. The study presents empirical results demonstrating improvements in both coverage and bug detection capabilities.
