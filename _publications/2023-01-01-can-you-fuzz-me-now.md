In this work, we propose a configuration-aware kernel fuzzing approach that addresses blind spots in kernel configurations. The methodology focuses on enhancing the detection of subtle and hard-to-find bugs by analyzing configuration-induced discrepancies. The approach demonstrated a significant improvement in bug detection rates and provides a foundation for future research in automated security testing.
